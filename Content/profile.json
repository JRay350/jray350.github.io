    "Title": "Sallen Key Bandpass Filter Indicator",
    "Desc": "In this project, I designed and optimized a 4th-order Sallen-Key bandpass filter for an IR system, tuned to 17 kHz with at least -12 dB attenuation at 10 kHz and 25 kHz. I first derived a filter based on a transfer function tested in MATLAB, before subsequently simulating in Multisim with an AC sweep and building the filter. From there, I utilized the digital oscilloscopes FRA to test my physical circuit. Afterwards, I integrated a peak detector and comparator to detect passing signals and to trigger an LED indicator that would only pass when the input has the correct frequency. I validated each step of the process with osilloscope analysis, ensuring that the results are what I expected.",

    "Title": "AI Cat Feeder System",
    "Desc": "Developed a low-power AI system, leveraging Python and TensorFlow Lite on Raspberry Pi 4 with custom 3D-printed housing. This project served to eliminate unwanted wildlife feeding and food waste by engineering an intelligent detection system and training a quantized CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model, achieving 84.2% precision in real-time classification between cats and raccoons using computer vision. For the project, I designed real-time user feedback by spearheading cross-functional development of fail-safe hardware interfaces, implementing stepper motor control, LED indicators, OLED display drivers, and system reset protocols.",
